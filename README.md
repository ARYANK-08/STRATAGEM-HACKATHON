# STRATAGEM-HACKATHON
In our website, one can sign up by filling basic details and then logging in to
book an appointment where the patient will have to provide some
necessary health related information and upload an image of themselves
which will be used to detect the patient whenever they arrive at the
hospital. On arriving at the hospital our camera will be able to detect the
patient and match with the image provided while booking the
appointment to see if the right patient is present and the admin can access
the data of the patient. This has proven to be hassle free and time efficient.
